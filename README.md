# horde-activesync
Debian based shell script that installs basic horde+postfix+spamassassin+active sync+mysql

It is customised to my needs but can be used as an example for another similar installation.

The script is based on an older one for Ubuntu 14 that I found on the net.

Additional files are there to add users and self signed SSL certificates if needed.
